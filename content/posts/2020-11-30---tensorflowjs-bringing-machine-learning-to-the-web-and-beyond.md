description: "Machine Learning is a powerful tool that offers unique opportunities for JavaScript developers. This is why we created TensorFlow.js, a library for training and deploying ML models in the browser and in Node.js. In this talk, you will learn about the TensorFlow.js ecosystem: how to bring an existing ML model into your JS app and re-train the model using your data. We’ll also go over our efforts beyond the browser to bring ML to platforms such as React Native, Raspberry Pi, and Electron, and we’ll do a live demo of some of our favorite and unique applications!"
