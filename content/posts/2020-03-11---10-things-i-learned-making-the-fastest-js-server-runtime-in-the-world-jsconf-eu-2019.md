description: "This presentation is about server performance, which means that no time in the world would be enough to cover it all. Hopefully, I can share with you the top #10 things I’ve learned while putting JavaScript on the top of the server side benchmarks. You will learn about runtimes and engines, how some are more capable than others, and sometimes the obvious choice is not always the right one… This talk is about thinking outside of the box, being creative and don’t take anything for granted. We will debunk myths about native code vs script or RAM usage, it’s going to be fast! I promise!"
