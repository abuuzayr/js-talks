description: "Until 1992, the web was largely textual, reserved almost exclusively to academia, with the charm of searching for library books via card catalogs. The sea change came when a browser allowed for both text and images to now be displayed in the viewport. Despite some vehement opposition, this was described as the &quot;gateway to the riches of the internet&quot;. This was a technological advancement that some had wagered would further fuel more advacement. We now have seen technologies like APIs, PWAs, DevTools and many more. “The Shape Of The Web” is about both accomplishments and challenges that lay in past, present and future of the web - from its technologies employed and its employed technologists."
