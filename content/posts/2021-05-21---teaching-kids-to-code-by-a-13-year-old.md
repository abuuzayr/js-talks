description: "Teaching programming to children is hard. Computer Science topics can be difficult to grasp using standard programming languages and tools. Using MITâ€™s Scratch programming platform, creating games and working software is simple and fun thanks to their drag and drop interface. To prove that this is as simple as it sounds, this session will be led by a 13-year-old. What better way to learn how to teach kids how to code than by learning from a kid?"
