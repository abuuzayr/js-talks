description: "It’s almost here! Houdini — the future of CSS! This spec allows developers to write web worklets with JavaScript syntax and access the CSS Object Model for the very first time. Everything will change! In this talk, we’ll will walk through some of the visual magic we can create by using Houdini and its various upcoming browser APIs, and go through a live demo of how we can get started with implementation. Learn about how to use Houdini and what it means for the future of web application styling."
