description: "With nearly 1,000,000 packages, the npm ecosystem is the largest out there, by far – but the ecosystem and its package manager were created in more humble times, for small projects and packages centered around the Node.js ecosystem itself.

It’s about time we redefined package management for modern web development, and that redefinition is tink: a package unwinder for JavaScript brought to you by npm itself. With tink, you’ll find unprecedented speeds, deep compatibility with everything from Node.js to bundlers, and a UX workflow optimized for the modern web developer. Come join us for the official unveiling and find out what the future of all package management will look like for years to come."
