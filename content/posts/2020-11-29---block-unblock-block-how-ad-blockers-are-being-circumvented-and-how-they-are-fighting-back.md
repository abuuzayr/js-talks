description: "As usage of ad blocking software has risen over the years, an entire micro-industry has popped up catering to publishers - promising to get around the ad blocker and show ads to users of ad blocking software. Some of these techniques rely on browser bugs, or limitations of browser extensions and some are just extremely creative ways to get around ad-blockers. This has forced ad blockers to come up with their own ingenious ways to counter and block the circumvented ads. In this talk, we’ll go over some of the techniques used in this cat and mouse game between ad blocking extensions and the people who want to circumvent them. It’s a fascinating peek into a world very few people seem to know."
