This enables developers to write Android applications in JavaScript and directly access the underlying OS. Come to this session to learn what challenges the NativeScript team met embedding V8 in a mobile framework and how you can power any C++ based application with one of the most sophisticated JavaScript engines.",

    "description": "Before personal computing became a thing, there was a handful of programmers and artists saw computers as a tool beyond their intended purpose: to create art. In this talk, we will explore the early history of computer art, from ghostly oscilloscope paints to pre-ASCII text art. We’ll discuss how simple techniques with limited technology back then could yield compelling pieces. We’ll see how the history of computer displays and printers have evolved in the 1950s to 1980s. While quite a bit of retro art survives today, most of them do not come preserved with their algorithms. In this talk, I’ll also demo some attempts to recreate retro art pieces using p5.js, a JavaScript graphics library as well as talk through some of the techniques of creating generative computer art.",

    "description": "Node.js has been using a derivative of nginx’s parser with a lot of customization/rewrite since its inception. Despite being fast enough, the project architecture made it very hard to maintain in a long run. To mitigate that, the author has created a tool to generate the new HTTP parser called “llhttp” from the TypeScript code in understandable, verifiable, and maintainable way. Incidentally, the performance of “llhttp” is two times better than of the old parser. In this talk we’ll walk through the basics of generating such parsers and how “llhttp” works.",

It’s more challenging if you have a thick British accent and your students are mostly African students. If you’ve ever designed a tech curriculum then you understand how complicated this can be. At code Afrique where we help the community by offering a free weekend intensive bootcamp, we explored and have now achieved success with ember where we had earlier failed. The aim of this talk is to show, what we tried, where we failed and how Javascript via Ember brought us success like no other.",

Instead of just listing a number of progressive enhancements and techniques, this talk will try to take a different approach. We’ll first explore who needs to consider improving their site in the first place and see if their is a messaging problem between advocates and developers in the community. We’ll then address concerns that can arise when performance is being worked on and discuss some real and practical solutions.",

Gigantic machines rewind huge rolls of tissue paper weighing almost a ton processing it at a speed of 40 km/h, and a single minute of downtime cuts into the slim margins of the paper industry. The asynchronous nature of Javascript and Node.JS allows telemetry data to be harvested from ancient PLCs controlling the production, and its real-time analysis in the cloud, enabling operators and factories to raise production quality, improve performance and reduce waste. Join me on a journey to understand how modern programming techniques make IIoT and Industry 4.0 a reality today in the toilet paper world!",

    "description": "Many would argue there are only two hard problems in software: naming and cache invalidation. I’d argue there’s a third problem - abstractions. Whether you’re implementing an API for devs outside of your organization or creating a reusable library for devs on your team, creating the right level of abstraction is difficult. You have to balance flexibility with the ease-of-use. The correct choice is often a function of time constraints, compromise, and trial & error. I’ll talk about how to navigate these issues more efficiently.",

    "description": "Teaching programming to children is hard. Computer Science topics can be difficult to grasp using standard programming languages and tools. Using MIT’s Scratch programming platform, creating games and working software is simple and fun thanks to their drag and drop interface. To prove that this is as simple as it sounds, this session will be led by a 13-year-old. What better way to learn how to teach kids how to code than by learning from a kid?",

    "description": "“Queers hate techies,” the slogan proudly proclaimed in a window in San Francisco. Being a queer techie, I was immediately conflicted. The tech industry provides a safe haven for many queer folks, myself included. It offers stable employement to us more willingly than other industries. These benefits don’t extend to all queer folks though, and these benefits are often revoked as soon as we step out of line. Queer folks are a model minority in an industry who’s products often negatively impact our community. This talk will dive into these complications and how we can improve the tech industry to make it a truly welcoming place for queer folks.",

    "description": "Not long ago, it seemed like JavaScript devices were going to free JS developers from the constraints of the browser and let us control every aspect of our lives as easily as we once controlled hover menus. Though nodebots were captivating, many of us were anxious for the JS device revolution to reach a more mundane destination: our phones. And yet today the constraints of the mobile landscape look not much different from several years ago. We have the same two operating systems, the same two app stores, and same option to write a native app or push people to save what is still mostly a bookmark. How did we cover so little distance, given the enthusiasm, resources, and potential that appeared to exist, and more importantly, how close can we come to a JavaScript phone today?",

    "description": "Until 1992, the web was largely textual, reserved almost exclusively to academia, with the charm of searching for library books via card catalogs. The sea change came when a browser allowed for both text and images to now be displayed in the viewport. Despite some vehement opposition, this was described as the \"gateway to the riches of the internet\". This was a technological advancement that some had wagered would further fuel more advacement. We now have seen technologies like APIs, PWAs, DevTools and many more. “The Shape Of The Web” is about both accomplishments and challenges that lay in past, present and future of the web - from its technologies employed and its employed technologists.",

    "description": "In 2009 I was managing Yahoo’s tech event budget when we agreed to sponsor the very first JSConf, the one that almost didn’t happen, the one that started something… And though I’ve still never attended a JSConf, nor learned to code, the zeitgeist of the JavaScript community and its event culture have had a profound effect on how I live and the devrel work I do. I’d like to speak about cultivating “JavaScript: The Good Times”—the evolution of inclusiveness, the effort to replace customs that no longer reflect the values and demographics of the community, the focus on new practices for joyful conference-going and knowledge sharing. The JavaScript ethos has fueled a reinvention of the tech gathering as an act of participation and experiment, generating enduring artifacts for learning and excellent new habits for our relationships - personal and professional.",

    "description": "Javascript runs on nearly any platform. Most languages can compile to Javascript. It’s well-positioned to become the lingua franca of programmers, with one problem: Like most programming languages, Javascript is based on English. 89% of the world’s population doesn’t speak any English. Many of those people can’t even read the Latin script. If we want Javascript to be a lingua franca, we need to ensure it is accessible to all people, regardless of their native language. Let’s look at the barriers that non-native speakers face when contributing to OSS Javascript projects and what it would take to remove them entirely, so that two developers could collaborate without speaking the same language. We will see what techniques Javascript can borrow from other languages by taking a look at করো (koro), a project which adds Bengali support to the Go compiler. And, we will learn enough about compilers and character encoding to answer the eternal question: “Could we do this in Javascript?”",

    "description": "Remember loving to read comics on a Sunday afternoon when you were a kid? Maybe you don’t. In the past, traditional print comics have made it impossible for blind and visually-impaired readers to experience their heroes’ adventures first-hand. Today an increasing number of initiatives like comic book stores for the blind aim to overcome this challenge. What if I told you that the web platform empowers us to even create comics for literally everyone? Alongside a demo application, you see how accessibility best practices enable you to craft an immersive webcomic experience that is not only engaging for the sighted but accessible for everyone.",
